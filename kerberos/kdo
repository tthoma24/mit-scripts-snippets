# kdo is a shell function for interacting with multiple Kerberos
# credential caches.
#
# To use kdo, add this snippet to your .bashrc or .bashrc.mine file.
#
# To run a command with a different set of credentials from your
# default, run
#
#     kdo <principal> <command>
#
# e.g.,
#
#     kdo broder/root aklog
#
# If you lack credentials for the specified principal, you'll be
# prompted for the password.
#
# If kdo needs to acquire tickets, it will pass the value of
# ${kdo_args[@]} to kinit. I use this to get tickets that last for 15
# minutes, that are renewable for 60 minutes, and aren't forwardable.
#
# To add kdo support for a new platform, you need to provide an
# interface to multiple credential caches by defining two functions:
#
#  - kcaches::
#      Print one line per current credential cache of the form "<PRINCIPAL> <KRB5CCNAME>"
#  - knewcache::
#      Without changing the current credentials cache, get credentials
#      for the principal in $1, passing the remaining arguments to
#      kinit.
#      knewcache should set the variable cache with the KRB5CCNAME
#      value for the newly created credential cache
#
# Also included is krootssh, a wrapper around ssh for using your
# root-instance tickets with ssh. It ensures that your tickets don't
# get accidentally forwarded, on the off chance that you have
# forwardable tickets.
